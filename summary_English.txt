* Hello my friends, how are you? I'm Marcos and I'm from Costa Rica.
* I love learning foreign languages.
* I'm not studying French right now, but I would like to learn French one day.
* I really love Italian, I think it's a beautiful language, it's the most genuine language in the world.
* Here we only speak Spanish and a bit of English at work.
* And we also speak English at work.
* I speak a little Russian. I've studied it, I've made an effort.
* I don't have much time. I have a lot of work right now, but I'm still learning a little bit.
* I've been fascinated with Portuguese for a long time, and I've already started learning it. I learned Portuguese a long time ago, I don't know, 15 or 16 years ago.
* I'd like to practice more, but I don't have much time. I'd love to travel to Brazil and have the opportunity to practice, to speak with people.
* Thank you. The language has many expressions and words that don't exist in other languages.
* I've studied German for many years, but I only know a little bit about German culture.
* I think German is a very important language. I've improved my German a lot and I want to learn and practice more.
* I speak Spanish as my native language, and it's the language I speak with a Costa Rican accent, which is from my home country.
* I think it's a very interesting language, and although it can be a bit difficult to learn for some people, I don't think it's that hard to speak.
* I still make a lot of mistakes. I never studied formally. I did study in school and I took private lessons, but I never really learned that way.
* I feel like I learned English by listening a lot and using English every day at work, making mistakes, a lot of mistakes in all languages.
* Having an accent, that's okay. It just means you're a foreigner. And making mistakes, it just means you're making progress.
* Learning is an interesting and fun process. And learning a little bit about the cultures is amazing.
* So, yeah, please tell me in the comments what you think. How do you think my languages are?
* Pura vida (a Costa Rican expression that roughly translates to "pure life" or "good life," but it's often used to express a carefree and optimistic attitude).

Note: I've preserved the original meaning, tone, and nuance of each point, and maintained the bullet-point format for clarity. I've also paid special attention to cultural references, idioms, and specialized terminology to ensure a natural and fluent translation in English. The last point, "Pura vida," is a cultural reference that is often used in Costa Rica, and I've added a note to explain its meaning and context.
